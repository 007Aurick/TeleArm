# 🦾 TeleARM — Autonomous Perception-Guided Mobile Manipulator

> An autonomous mobile robot that detects objects with a camera, navigates to them while avoiding obstacles with LiDAR, and picks them up using a mounted robotic arm — all visualized live in RViz2.

## 📖 Overview

**TeleARM** combines perception, autonomous navigation, and manipulation into one working robot:

- 📷 **Camera-based object detection** — spot a target object in the environment
- 🗺️ **Autonomous navigation** using `Nav2` + LiDAR, driving to the detected object while avoiding obstacles
- 🦾 **Automatic pick-and-place** using a mounted robotic arm, triggered on arrival

No keyboard, no manual driving, no manual goal-setting — the robot decides where to go and what to do based on what it sees.

---

## ✨ Features

- 📷 Real-time object detection from a mounted RGB(-D) camera
- 📍 Detected object position converted into a navigation goal in the map frame
- 🧭 Fully autonomous point-to-point navigation via `Nav2`, using LiDAR-based obstacle avoidance
- 🌲 Full TF tree: `map → odom → base_link → arm_base_link → ... → gripper`
- 🦾 Fixed-mount robotic arm riding on top of the mobile base
- 🤖 Automatic pick-and-place sequence triggered on goal arrival (no keypress needed)
- 🖥️ Fully visualized in RViz2 — robot model, TF frames, LiDAR scan, occupancy grid map, camera feed, and detected object markers

🖥️ RViz2 renders everything together

- **Perception** (camera) decides *where* the robot should go.
- **Navigation** (`Nav2` + LiDAR) decides *how* to get there safely.
- **Manipulation** (arm) executes *what* happens once the robot arrives.
- Each subsystem is modular — detection, navigation, and arm control communicate only through well-defined topics/goals, not tight coupling.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- ROS2 Humble
- Gazebo
- `slam_toolbox`
- `Nav2`
- OpenCV (or equivalent) for object detection

### Build
```bash
cd ~/telearm_ws
colcon build --symlink-install
source install/setup.bash
```

### Run
```bash
# Terminal 1 — launch simulation + robot
ros2 launch telearm_bringup telearm_sim.launch.py

# Terminal 2 — launch Nav2 with a saved map
ros2 launch telearm_bringup navigation.launch.py

# Terminal 3 — start object detection
ros2 run telearm_perception object_detector

# Terminal 4 — arm control node
ros2 run telearm_arm_control pick_place_trigger
```

The robot detects an object with its camera, autonomously navigates to it while avoiding obstacles, and triggers the arm's pick-and-place sequence on arrival. 🦾📦
